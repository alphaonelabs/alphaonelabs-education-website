# GitHub Actions Workflows Documentation

This document describes the GitHub Actions workflows used in this project.

## Production Deployment Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`

**Trigger:** Manual (workflow_dispatch)

### Purpose

This workflow automates the deployment of the application to the production server and creates a new GitHub release with version tracking.

### Features

1. **Automated Deployment**
   - Connects to production server via SSH
   - Pulls latest code from the main branch
   - Installs/updates dependencies using Poetry
   - Runs database migrations
   - Collects static files
   - Restarts application and nginx services

2. **Deployment Verification**
   - Checks if the application service is running
   - Verifies nginx is operational

3. **Automatic Release Creation**
   - Retrieves the latest release tag
   - Increments the version number automatically
   - Generates release notes from commits since the last release
   - Creates a new GitHub release with the version tag
   - Pushes the version tag to the repository

### Version Scheme

- Uses semantic versioning: `vMAJOR.MINOR` (e.g., v1.0, v1.1, v2.0)
- Automatically increments the **minor** version on each deployment
- Default starting version is `v0.0` if no previous releases exist
- Examples:
  - v1.0 → v1.1 → v1.2 → v1.3
  - v2.0 → v2.1 → v2.2

### Release Notes

Release notes are automatically generated and include:
- Production deployment title with version number
- Deployment date and time (UTC)
- List of commits since the last release
- Commit messages with short SHA hashes
- Footer indicating automated creation

Example release notes:
```markdown
## Production Deployment - v1.1

**Deployment Date:** 2025-10-05 12:00:00 UTC

### Changes in this release:

- Add user authentication feature (abc1234)
- Fix navigation bug (def5678)
- Update dependencies (ghi9012)

### How to Deploy

1. Go to the [Actions](../../actions) tab in GitHub
2. Select "Deploy to Production" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select the branch (usually `main`)
5. Click "Run workflow" button

The workflow will:
1. Deploy the code to production
2. Verify the deployment
3. Create a new release (e.g., v1.0 → v1.1)
4. Tag the commit with the new version

### Requirements

The workflow requires the following GitHub secrets to be configured:

- `PRODUCTION_SERVER_IP`: IP address of the production server
- `PRODUCTION_SERVER_USER`: SSH username for the production server
- `PRODUCTION_SERVER_PASSWORD`: SSH password for the production server

### Permissions

The workflow has `contents: write` permission to:
- Create and push version tags
- Create GitHub releases

### Notes

- The workflow uses SSH password authentication via `sshpass`
- Host key checking is disabled for the production server
- The workflow tags the current HEAD of the branch being deployed
- All merge commits are excluded from the release notes
- If deployment fails, the release will not be created

### Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Deployment fails at SSH connection
- **Solution:** Verify server secrets are correctly configured

**Issue:** Version tag already exists
- **Solution:** Manually delete the tag or increment the version scheme

**Issue:** Permission denied when creating release
- **Solution:** Ensure the workflow has `contents: write` permission

## Other Workflows

### Label Issues by Creation Date Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/label-issues-by-date.yml`

**Triggers:**
- Daily at midnight UTC (scheduled)
- Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch

**Purpose:** Automatically labels issues with their creation date in YYYY-MM format (e.g., 2024-01, 2024-02).

**Features:**
- Processes all issues (both open and closed) in the repository
- Creates date labels automatically if they don't exist
- Uses color-coded labels based on the month
- Skips issues that already have a date label
- Skips pull requests (only processes issues)
- Runs daily to label new issues automatically

**How it works:**
1. Fetches all issues from the repository
2. Extracts the creation date of each issue
3. Formats the date as YYYY-MM (e.g., 2024-12)
4. Creates the label if it doesn't exist with a month-specific color
5. Adds the label to the issue

**Manual Trigger:**
1. Go to the [Actions](../../actions) tab in GitHub
2. Select "Label Issues by Creation Date" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Click "Run workflow" button

**Use Cases:**
- Track when issues were created
- Filter and organize issues by time period
- Generate reports based on issue creation dates
- Monitor issue trends over time

### Test Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- Runs linting checks
- Executes unit tests
- Performs security scans

### Pre-commit Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml`
- Validates code formatting
- Checks code quality

### CodeQL Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
- Performs security analysis
- Detects vulnerabilities

### Check Migrations Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/check-migrations.yml`
- Validates Django migrations
- Checks for migration conflicts

### Copilot PR Label Tracker Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/copilot-label-tracker.yml`

**Triggers:**
- `issue_comment` (created) — fires when a new comment is posted on any issue or PR
- `pull_request_review` (submitted) — fires when a pull request review is submitted
- Scheduled every 10 minutes (`*/10 * * * *`)

**Purpose:** Automatically applies labels to pull requests based on GitHub Copilot's activity.

**Labels managed:**
| Label | Color | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `copilot-working` | Yellow (`fbca04`) | Copilot reacted with 👀 to a PR comment — work is in progress |
| `copilot-finished` | Green (`0e8a16`) | Copilot posted a comment or review — work is complete |

**How it works:**

1. **Detecting the 👀 reaction (scheduled job)**
   - Runs every 10 minutes against all open PRs
   - For each PR that does not yet have a `copilot-working` or `copilot-finished` label, fetches all
     issue-level comments and their reactions
   - If any comment has an `eyes` (👀) reaction from a known Copilot account, adds the
     `copilot-working` label to the PR

2. **Detecting a Copilot comment or review (event-driven job)**
   - Triggers immediately when a new comment or pull request review is submitted
   - Checks whether the author is a known Copilot account
     (`copilot-swe-agent[bot]`, `copilot[bot]`, `github-copilot[bot]`, etc.)
   - If so, removes `copilot-working` (if present) and adds `copilot-finished`

**Known Copilot accounts checked:**
- `copilot-swe-agent[bot]`
- `copilot[bot]`
- `github-copilot[bot]`
- `Copilot`
- `copilot`

**Notes:**
- Both labels are created automatically if they do not already exist in the repository
- The scheduled job skips PRs that already carry either label to avoid duplicate work
- The `copilot-finished` label is idempotent — it will not be added twice
