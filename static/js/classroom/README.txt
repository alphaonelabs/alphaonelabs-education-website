VIRTUAL CLASSROOM IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

This guide provides detailed steps to implement the virtual classroom game with Phaser.js in your education website.

1. OVERVIEW

The virtual classroom is an interactive game environment where users can:
- Move around a classroom using a character
- Interact with classroom objects like whiteboards, chairs, and desks
- See who is sitting on which chair
- Access educational content through interactions (e.g., clicking on the whiteboard)

2. FILES AND STRUCTURE

We have created the following files and components:

Frontend:
- web/templates/classroom.html: Main template for the virtual classroom
- static/js/classroom/game.js: Main Phaser.js game implementation
- static/images/classroom/: Directory for game assets

Backend:
- web/classroom_views.py: Django views for classroom functionality
- Models in web/models.py:
  - ClassroomGameState: Stores player positions
  - ChairOccupancy: Tracks which user is sitting on which chair
- URL patterns in web/urls.py for classroom endpoints

3. IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

3.1 Creating Game Assets

1. Character Spritesheet
   - Create or find a character spritesheet with animations for walking in 4 directions
   - Place in static/images/classroom/character.png

2. Classroom Objects
   - Create or find images for: whiteboard, chair, desk, window, door
   - Place in static/images/classroom/

3.2 Setting Up Phaser.js

1. Install Phaser.js
   - Phaser.js is already included from CDN in the classroom.html template

2. Initialize Game
   - The game instance is configured in game.js
   - Physics are set up for collision detection
   - All game scenes are implemented

3.3 Implementing Game Features

1. Character Movement
   - Keyboard controls (arrow keys and WASD) are set up
   - Animations for character movement are defined
   - Collision detection is implemented with classroom objects

2. Interactive Objects
   - Whiteboard: Links to the whiteboard page when interacted with
   - Chairs: Track occupancy and can be sat on or stood up from
   - Desks: Act as obstacles and visual elements
   - Windows and door: Add visual elements to the classroom

3. Multiplayer Functionality
   - Chair occupancy is tracked in the database
   - Players can see which chairs are occupied and by whom
   - Game state is periodically saved to the server

3.4 Django Backend

1. Models
   - ClassroomGameState: Stores player position
   - ChairOccupancy: Tracks chair assignments

2. API Endpoints
   - save_classroom_state: Save player position
   - update_chair_state: Update chair occupancy

3. Integration with Existing Website
   - A link has been added in the navigation menu
   - The game uses the existing user authentication system

4. EXTENDING THE VIRTUAL CLASSROOM

Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

1. Real-time Multiplayer
   - Add Channels/WebSockets for real-time updates
   - Show other players moving in real-time

2. Additional Interactive Elements
   - Interactive books that link to course materials
   - Computer stations with coding exercises
   - Teacher's desk with access to gradebook

3. Classroom Customization
   - Allow teachers to customize classroom layout
   - Add different classroom themes

4. Gamification Elements
   - Add achievements for classroom participation
   - Implement a reward system for active learners

5. REQUIRED ASSETS

To implement the virtual classroom, you'll need the following assets:

1. Character Spritesheet
   - Size: 128×192 pixels (4×4 grid with 32×48 per frame)
   - 16 frames (4 directions × 4 frames per direction)

2. Classroom Objects
   - Whiteboard: 400×200 pixels
   - Chair: 40×60 pixels
   - Desk: 80×60 pixels
   - Window: 150×100 pixels
   - Door: 80×120 pixels

You can create these assets or find suitable ones from asset marketplaces or open-source game art sites.
